\section*{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}

      % There should be an item corresponding to each of the agenda items for
      % this meeting.

      \item Minutes from the previous meeting were read and approved.

      \item No matters arose from previous meetings

      \item Progress report from group members
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item Keith reported that the audio input circuit although works is highly delicate and is not always
                  reliable due to the low frequency of the audio line input.
                  \item Jhonas reported that the following functions where completed; safe malloc, closest frequency and filtering dtmf
                  \item Gabriel and Allesandro reported that the fast fourier transform was also successfully able to 
                  find the frequencies of a sin wave during tests meaning that it is working as expected
            \end{enumerate}

      \item Targets set for the week
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item Complete the signal input
                  \item Start decoding frequencies
            \end{enumerate}
            
      \item No other matters were discussed
\end{enumerate}
